\section{Abstract}

Cell lineage tracing is the practice of determining how each cell in an adult organism arises from the single progenitor zygotic cell.
The practice is commonly used in stem cell studies and studies of cancer heterogeneity.
Usually, tracing is performed by direct observation of a marked cell and its decendants.
There is interest in sequencing somatic variants in decendant cells to infer cell lineages in environments that make direct observation or genetic manipulation intractable, such as in humans.
Some successful approaches in mouse use microsatellite markers, but such methods are not generally extendable.
For example, the number of microsatellites in the \textit{C. elegans} genome is likely not sufficient to reliably produce a cell fate map with microsatellite sequencing.
However, the detailed \textit{C. elegans} cell fate map provides an opportunity to create a generic method for reconstructing cell lineages via whole genome sequencing. 
% Cancer is a devastating disease caused by mutations in somatic cells that cause those cells to rapidly proliferate and evade the immune system.
% Despite this fact, little is known about how somatic mutations are produced and spread.

\textbf{Aim 1} of the project is to develop a method of inferring cell fate maps from whole-genome sequencing data.
To test this hypothesis, cells isolated from transgenic \textit{C. elegans} that fluoresce in a tissue-specific manner will be separated by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting and sequenced.

\textbf{Aim 2} of the project is to test the hypothesis that cell lineage trees derived from whole genome sequencing data more closely correlate to known cell fate maps than do those inferred by microsatellites alone.
To test this hypothesis, the cell fate map inference method will be compared to one generated solely from microsatellites and the true cell fate map.
These results will improve the understanding of how somatic mutations arise and will impact the fields of immunology and cancer biology.
