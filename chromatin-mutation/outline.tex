% • What do you intend to do?
% • Why is this worth doing or the significance of the research? How is it innovative?
% • What has already been done in general, and what have other researchers done
% in this field? Use appropriate references. What will this new work add to the field
% of knowledge?
% • What have you (and your collaborators) done to establish the feasibility of what
% you are proposing to do?
% • How will the research be accomplished? Who? What? When? Where? Why?

% 1. Make sure that all sections are internally consistent and that they dovetail with each
% other. Use a numbering system, and make sections easy to find. Lead the reviewers
% through your research plan. One person should revise and edit the final draft.
% 2. Show knowledge of recent literature and explain how the proposed research will
% further what is already known.
% 3. Emphasize how some combination of a novel hypothesis, important preliminary
% data, a new experimental system and/or a new experimental approach will enable
% important progress to be made.
% 4. Establish credibility of the proposed principal investigator and the collaborating
% researchers.

		\item Somatic mutations play an important role in carcinogenesis
		\begin{outline}
			\item Genome instability is a hallmark of cancer \parencite{hanahan_hallmarks_2000, hanahan_hallmarks_2011}
			\item The Somatic Mutation Theory of cancer suggests that somatic mutations slowly accumulate until a sufficient number disrupt normal cell cycle control \parencite{tomasetti_variation_2015}
			\item There is disagreement on the role somatic mutations play in carcinogenesis \parencite{baker_cancer_2015}
			\begin{outline}
				\item The Somatic Mutation Theory doesn't explain how a sufficient number of somatic mutations accumulate \parencite{baker_cancer_2015}
				\item Variation in somatic tissue division rates explains a large proportion of variation in incidence by tissue \parencite{tomasetti_variation_2015} implying cancer is caused by mutations that occur during cell division, but there is disagreement \parencite{rozhok_critical_2015, wang_implications_2015}
				\item Our understanding of the rate of somatic mutations, and how that changes in different types of cells, is limited \parencite{stratton_cancer_2009}
