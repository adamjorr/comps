% • What do you intend to do?
% • Why is this worth doing or the significance of the research? How is it innovative?
% • What has already been done in general, and what have other researchers done
% in this field? Use appropriate references. What will this new work add to the field
% of knowledge?
% • What have you (and your collaborators) done to establish the feasibility of what
% you are proposing to do?
% • How will the research be accomplished? Who? What? When? Where? Why?

% 1. Make sure that all sections are internally consistent and that they dovetail with each
% other. Use a numbering system, and make sections easy to find. Lead the reviewers
% through your research plan. One person should revise and edit the final draft.
% 2. Show knowledge of recent literature and explain how the proposed research will
% further what is already known.
% 3. Emphasize how some combination of a novel hypothesis, important preliminary
% data, a new experimental system and/or a new experimental approach will enable
% important progress to be made.
% 4. Establish credibility of the proposed principal investigator and the collaborating
% researchers.
