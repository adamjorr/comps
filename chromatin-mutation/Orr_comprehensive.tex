% why study somatic mutation and its relationship to chromatin accessibility?
Somatic mutations are mutations that occur in somatic cells, and as such are not passed to offspring.
These mutations arise due to errors in DNA replication preceding cell division.
While the DNA replication and error repair machinery is highly accurate, mutations occur at high enough frequencies to be significant.
Current assumptions of error rate and genome size imply that on average each cell division results in the accumulation of one novel mutation in the daughter cells.

These mutations are central to the somatic mutation theory of cancer.
This theory posits that cancers arise in multicellular organisms when somatic cells of that organism accumulate a sufficient number of mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes induces tumorigenesis.
Important mutations in oncogenes cause them to be over activated, promoting unnecessary cell proliferation.
In contrast, relevant mutations in tumor suppressor genes cause them to lose functionality, inhibiting their ability to limit cell proliferation.
Once a sufficient number of these mutations accumulate, the cell divides rapidly and accumulates even more somatic mutations, severely destabilizing the genome.

While there has been a large body of work on the generation of somatic mutations in the presence of mutagens, much less is known about the endogenous process that generates somatic mutations--that is, the process that generates somatic mutations even in cells that are never exposed to mutagens or unusual stress.
% Despite the critical role somatic mutations play in tumorigenesis, these mutations are usually studied only in tumors, as there are a sufficient number of mutations that a significant number can be detected at modest sequencing depth.
% However, most of these mutations did not cause the tumor, and occur only after the tumor has formed.
This impedes researchers' ability to detect significant departures from healthy levels and patterns of somatic mutation;
a significant amount of energy is expended in differentiating non-pathogenic "passenger" mutations from the "driver" mutations that actually contribute to tumor formation.
This knowledge gap is largely due to the technical difficulty of detecting somatic mutations in healthy tissues.
In any sample of healthy tissue, the number of somatic mutations within the sample is expected to be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of sequencing errors.
A reliable method of detecting somatic mutations in healthy cells and non-tumor samples will enable researchers to study somatic mutations in healthy tissue, improving their ability to distinguish between natural patterns of somatic variation and unhealthy levels of somatic variation indicative of disease.
