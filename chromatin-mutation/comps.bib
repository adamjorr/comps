	abstract = {Developmental genetic studies in Drosophila unraveled the importance of Polycomb group ({PcG}) and Trithorax group ({TrxG}) genes in controlling cellular identity. {PcG} and {TrxG} proteins form histone modifying complexes that catalyze repressive or activating histone modifications, respectively, and thus maintaining the expression status of homeotic genes. Human orthologs of {PcG} and {TrxG} genes are implicated in tumorigenesis as well as in determining the prognosis of individual cancers. Recent whole genome analyses of cancers also highlighted the importance of histone modifying proteins in controlling tumorigenesis. Comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic relationship between histone regulation and tumorigenesis holds the promise of significantly advancing our understanding and management of cancer. It is anticipated that Drosophila melanogaster, the model organism that contributed significantly to our understanding of the functional role of histone regulation in development, could also provide unique insight for our understanding of how histone dysregulation can lead to cancer. In this review, we will discuss several recent advances in this regard.},

We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, {MuTect} has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making {MuTect} particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.},

The chromosomal infrastructure is essential for gene control, determining both active and repressed states. It is important not only to turn the right genes on but also to turn the right genes off. Histones and chromatin components have key roles in this decision making process. Mistakes have severe consequences. If as few as three inappropriate genes are turned off, a normal cell can be converted into a cancer cell. This epigenetic silencing of genes underlies a new approach to cancer therapy. Advances in the biochemistry and genetics of chromatin remodeling reveal that gene inactivation depends on the recruitment of enzymes that control the display of {DNA} within the chromosome. Mistargeting of these enzymes leads to tumorigenesis, but inhibition of their activity presents a novel approach to therapy. Oncogene (2001) 20, 2988-2990.},

The mutations and genes identified in this fashion showed strong relevance to cancer, in contrast to noncoding mutations with site-specific recurrence only. We developed a prediction method that identifies potentially recurrent mutations on the basis of the features shared by mutations whose recurrence is observed in a given cohort. Our method was capable of accurately predicting recurrent mutations at the level of target genes but not mutations recurring at the same site. We experimentally validated predicted mutations in distal regulatory regions of the {TERT} gene.

Deciphering the molecular determinants of this variation will be aided by the elucidation of distinct types of mutations, as they differ in regional preferences and in associations with genomic features. Chromatin organization contributes to regional variation in mutation rates, but its contribution differs among mutation types. In both germline and somatic mutations, base substitutions are more abundant in regions of closed chromatin, perhaps reflecting error accumulation late in replication. By contrast, a distinctive mutational state with very high levels of insertions and deletions (indels) and substitutions is enriched in regions of open chromatin. These associations indicate an intricate interplay between the nucleotide sequence of {DNA} and its dynamic packaging into chromatin, and have important implications for current biomedical research. This Review focuses on recent studies showing associations between chromatin state and mutation rates, including pairwise and multivariate investigations of germline and somatic (particularly cancer) mutations.},

Instead, different human genomic regions vary by up to fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic mutations, posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in cancer genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major determinant of the cancer mutational landscape. However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly cell-type-specific. We investigated the distribution of mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here we show that chromatin accessibility and modification, together with replication timing, explain up to 86\% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes. The best predictors of local somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined based on the distribution of mutations along its genome. Thus, the {DNA} sequence of a cancer genome encompasses a wealth of information about the identity and epigenomic features of its cell of origin.},

We show that there is significant variation in the density of mutations at the 1-Mb scale within three cancer genomes and that the density of mutations is correlated between them. We also demonstrate that the density of mutations is correlated to that in the germline, as measured by the divergence between humans and chimpanzees and humans and macaques. We show that the density of mutations is correlated to the guanine and cytosine ({GC}) conent, replication time, distance to telomere and centromere, gene density, and nucleosome occupancy in the cancer genomes. However, overall, all factors explain less than 40\% of the variance in mutation density and each factor explains very little of the variance. We find that genes associated with cancer occupy regions of the genome with significantly lower mutation rates than the average. Finally, we show that the density of mutations varies at a 10-Mb and a chromosomal scale, but that the variation at these scales is weak. Hum Mutat 33:136–143, 2012. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types.

A significant component of cancer etiology has been deemed stochastic and correlated with the number of stem cells in a tissue, the number of times the stem cells divide and a low incidence of random {DNA} polymerase errors that occur during each cell division. While somatic mutations occur during each round of {DNA} replication, mutations in cancer driver genes are not stochastic. Out of a total of 2843 codons, 1031 can be changed to stop codons by a single base substitution in the tumor suppressor {APC} gene, which is mutated in 76\% of colorectal cancers ({CRC}). However, the nonsense mutations, which comprise 65\% of all the {APC} driver mutations in {CRC}, are not random: 43\% occur at Arg {CGA} codons, although they represent \&lt;3\% of the codons. In {TP}53, {CGA} codons comprise \&lt;3\% of the total 393 codons but they account for 72\% and 39\% of the mutations in {CRC} and ovarian cancer {OVC}, respectively. This mutation pattern is consistent with the kinetically slow, but not stochastic, hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine residues at specific methylated {CpG} sites to afford T·G mismatches that lead to C → T transitions and stop codons at {CGA}. Analysis of nonsense mutations in {CRC}, {OVC} and a number of other cancers indicates the need to expand the predictable risk factors for cancer to include, in addition to random polymerase errors, the methylation status of gene body {CGA} codons in tumor suppressor genes.},

Despite their prevalence, the contribution of somatic {MS} indels to cancer has been largely unexplored, owing to difficulties in detecting them in short-read sequencing data. Here we present two tools: {MSMuTect}, for accurate detection of somatic {MS} indels, and {MSMutSig}, for identification of genes containing {MS} indels at a higher frequency than expected by chance. Applying {MSMuTect} to whole-exome data from 6,747 human tumors representing 20 tumor types, we identified {\textgreater}1,000 previously undescribed {MS} indels in cancer genes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the number and pattern of {MS} indels can accurately distinguish microsatellite-stable tumors from tumors with microsatellite instability, thus potentially improving classification of clinically relevant subgroups. Finally, we identified seven {MS} indel driver hotspots: four in known cancer genes ({ACVR}2A, {RNF}43, {JAK}1, and {MSH}3) and three in genes not previously implicated as cancer drivers ({ESRP}1, {PRDM}2, and {DOCK}3).},

	abstract = {Crunching the numbers to explain cancer
Why do some tissues give rise to cancer in humans a million times more frequently than others? Tomasetti and Vogelstein conclude that these differences can be explained by the number of stem cell divisions. By plotting the lifetime incidence of various cancers against the estimated number of normal stem cell divisions in the corresponding tissues over a lifetime, they found a strong correlation extending over five orders of magnitude. This suggests that random errors occurring during {DNA} replication in normal stem cells are a major contributing factor in cancer development. Remarkably, this “bad luck” component explains a far greater number of cancers than do hereditary and environmental factors.
Science, this issue p. 78
Some tissue types give rise to human cancers millions of times more often than other tissue types. Although this has been recognized for more than a century, it has never been explained. Here, we show that the lifetime risk of cancers of many different types is strongly correlated (0.81) with the total number of divisions of the normal self-renewing cells maintaining that tissue’s homeostasis. These results suggest that only a third of the variation in cancer risk among tissues is attributable to environmental factors or inherited predispositions. The majority is due to “bad luck,” that is, random mutations arising during {DNA} replication in normal, noncancerous stem cells. This is important not only for understanding the disease but also for designing strategies to limit the mortality it causes.
Errors arising by chance during normal stem cell division explain more cancers than do hereditary or environmental factors.

Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

Some cells are relatively close descendants, having undergone a small number of cell divisions, while other cells may be hundreds or even thousands of divisions deep. So far, science was unable to provide even gross estimates for the depths of the vast majority of human and mouse cells. In this study, we show that precise depth estimates of cells can be obtained from the analysis of non-hazardous mutations that spontaneously accumulate during normal development.

The observation that mutations in the two human repair genes {MSH}2 and {MLH}1 are responsible for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, as well as a significant number of sporadic colorectal cancers, raises several questions about the role of these proteins and their family members in the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer. To address these questions, mice with inactivating mutations in all the known {mutS} and {mutL} homologs have been generated. The development of these mouse lines has permitted the systematic analysis of the role of each gene in the repair process and has underscored their significance in mutation avoidance and cancer susceptibility. These analyses were critical for our understanding of the function of these genes at the organismal level and also revealed an essential role for some of the {DNA} mismatch-repair genes in mammalian meiosis.},

This review will present recent advances in the study of how autosomal mutations form in somatic cells by focusing on the mouse Aprt and Tk model systems that have been developed to examine the formation of autosomal mutations in vivo. These loci can detect the entire spectrum of mutations known to inactivate tumor suppressor genes. Studies with these models have provided novel information on the frequencies and types of spontaneous autosomal mutations that occur in different cell types. They also show great promise for the screening of genotoxic effects resulting from environmental exposures and for the study of mutation when {DNA} repair pathways are compromised. Continued use of the mouse Aprt and Tk models will have a significant impact on our understanding of some of the earliest steps in the conversion of normal cells to those with malignant phenotypes.},

Here we present an amplification-free method of library preparation, in which the cluster amplification step, rather than the {PCR}, enriches for fully ligated template strands, reducing the incidence of duplicate sequences, improving read mapping and single nucleotide polymorphism calling and aiding de novo assembly. We illustrate this by generating and analyzing {DNA} sequences from extremely (G+C)-poor (Plasmodium falciparum), (G+C)-neutral (Escherichia coli) and (G+C)-rich (Bordetella pertussis) genomes.},

To make use of these data, we developed a novel open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, because existing packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths (5–50 kbp) at such high error rates (between ∼5\% and 40\% error). With this new method, we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary {MiSeq} data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate: The contig N50 length is more than ten times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678 kb versus 59.9 kbp) and has {\textgreater}99.88\% consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, {rRNAs}, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.},

	abstract = {Recent, surprising, and controversial discoveries have challenged conventional concepts regarding the origins and plasticity of stem cells, and their contributions to tissue regeneration, and highlight just how little is known about mammalian development in comparison to simpler model organisms. In the case of the transparent worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, Sulston and colleagues used a microscope to record the birth and death of every cell during its life, and the compilation of this “fate map” represents a milestone achievement of developmental biology. Determining a fate map for mammals or other higher organisms is more complicated because they are opaque, take a long time to mature, and have a tremendous number of cells. Consequently, fate mapping experiments have relied on tagging a progenitor cell with a dye or genetic marker in order to later identify its descendants. This approach, however, extracts little information because it demonstrates that a population of cells, all having inherited the same label, shares a common ancestor, but it does not reveal how cells in that population are related to one another. To avoid that problem, as well as technical limitations of current methods for mapping cell fate, we, and others, have developed a new strategy for retrospectively deriving cell fate maps by using phylogenetics to infer the order in which somatic mutations have arisen in the genomes of individual cells during development in multicellular organisms. {DNA} replication inevitably introduces mutations, particularly at repetitive sequences, every time a cell divides. It is thus possible to deduce the history of cell divisions by cataloging somatic mutations and phylogenetically reconstructing cell lineage. This approach has the potential to produce a complete mammalian cell fate map that, in principle, could describe the developmental lineage of any cell and help resolve outstanding questions of stem cell biology, tissue repair and maintenance, and aging.},

Not only do the reads (or paired-end reads) need to straddle a breakpoint, but repetitive elements often lead to ambiguities in the alignment of short reads. We propose to use the long-reads (up to 20 kb) possible with 3rd generation sequencing, specifically nanopore sequencing on the {MinION}. Nanopore sequencing relies on a similar concept to a Coulter counter, reading the {DNA} sequence from the change in electrical current resulting from a {DNA} strand being forced through a nanometer-sized pore embedded in a membrane. Though nanopore sequencing currently has a relatively high mismatch rate that precludes base substitution and small frameshift mutation detection, its accuracy is sufficient for {SV} detection because of its long reads. In fact, long reads in some cases may improve {SV} detection efficiency.We have tested nanopore sequencing to detect a series of well-characterized {SVs}, including large deletions, inversions, and translocations that inactivate the {CDKN}2A/p16 and {SMAD}4/{DPC}4 tumor suppressor genes in pancreatic cancer. Using {PCR} amplicon mixes, we have demonstrated that nanopore sequencing can detect large deletions, translocations and inversions at dilutions as low as 1:100, with as few as 500 reads per sample. Given the speed, small footprint, and low capital cost, nanopore sequencing could become the ideal tool for the low-level detection of cancer-associated {SVs} needed for molecular relapse, early detection, or therapeutic monitoring.},

Although rapidly accumulating publicly available {ChIP}-seq, {DNase}-seq and {ATAC}-seq data are a valuable resource for the systematic investigation of gene regulation processes, a lack of standardized curation, quality control and analysis procedures have hindered extensive reuse of these data. To overcome this challenge, we built the Cistrome database, a collection of {ChIP}-seq and chromatin accessibility data ({DNase}-seq and {ATAC}-seq) published before January 1, 2016, including 13 366 human and 9953 mouse samples. All the data have been carefully curated and processed with a streamlined analysis pipeline and evaluated with comprehensive quality control metrics. We have also created a user-friendly web server for data query, exploration and visualization. The resulting Cistrome {DB} (Cistrome Data Browser), available online at http://cistrome.org/db, is expected to become a valuable resource for transcriptional and epigenetic regulation studies.},

	abstract = {Summary
The study of gastric epithelial homeostasis and cancer has been hampered by the lack of stem cell markers and in vitro culture methods. The Wnt target gene Lgr5 marks stem cells in the small intestine, colon, and hair follicle. Here, we investigated Lgr5 expression in the stomach and assessed the stem cell potential of the Lgr5+ve cells by using in vivo lineage tracing. In neonatal stomach, Lgr5 was expressed at the base of prospective corpus and pyloric glands, whereas expression in the adult was predominantly restricted to the base of mature pyloric glands. Lineage tracing revealed these Lgr5+ve cells to be self-renewing, multipotent stem cells responsible for the long-term renewal of the gastric epithelium. With an in vitro culture system, single Lgr5+ve cells efficiently generated long-lived organoids resembling mature pyloric epithelium. The Lgr5 stem cell marker and culture method described here will be invaluable tools for accelerating research into gastric epithelial renewal, inflammation/infection, and cancer.},

Recent work has illustrated that these various progenitor populations reside in regionalized niches and are phenotypically distinct from one another. This degree of heterogeneity within the progenitor cell landscape in the cutaneous epithelium complicates our ability to target, purify and manipulate cutaneous epithelial stem cell subpopulations in adult skin. The techniques outlined in this chapter describe basic procedures for the isolation and purification of murine epithelial progenitors and assessing their capacity for ex vivo propagation.},

Patients with {FAP} develop multiple benign colorectal tumors. Recently, a mouse lineage that exhibits an autosomal dominantly inherited predisposition to multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) was described. Linkage analysis showed that the murine homolog of the {APC} gene ({mApc}) was tightly linked to the Min locus. Sequence comparison of {mApc} between normal and Min-affected mice identified a nonsense mutation, which cosegregated with the Min phenotype. This mutation is analogous to those found in {FAP} kindreds and in sporadic colorectal cancers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
