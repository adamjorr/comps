	abstract = {Developmental genetic studies in Drosophila unraveled the importance of Polycomb group ({PcG}) and Trithorax group ({TrxG}) genes in controlling cellular identity. {PcG} and {TrxG} proteins form histone modifying complexes that catalyze repressive or activating histone modifications, respectively, and thus maintaining the expression status of homeotic genes. Human orthologs of {PcG} and {TrxG} genes are implicated in tumorigenesis as well as in determining the prognosis of individual cancers. Recent whole genome analyses of cancers also highlighted the importance of histone modifying proteins in controlling tumorigenesis. Comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic relationship between histone regulation and tumorigenesis holds the promise of significantly advancing our understanding and management of cancer. It is anticipated that Drosophila melanogaster, the model organism that contributed significantly to our understanding of the functional role of histone regulation in development, could also provide unique insight for our understanding of how histone dysregulation can lead to cancer. In this review, we will discuss several recent advances in this regard.},

We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, {MuTect} has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making {MuTect} particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.},

The chromosomal infrastructure is essential for gene control, determining both active and repressed states. It is important not only to turn the right genes on but also to turn the right genes off. Histones and chromatin components have key roles in this decision making process. Mistakes have severe consequences. If as few as three inappropriate genes are turned off, a normal cell can be converted into a cancer cell. This epigenetic silencing of genes underlies a new approach to cancer therapy. Advances in the biochemistry and genetics of chromatin remodeling reveal that gene inactivation depends on the recruitment of enzymes that control the display of {DNA} within the chromosome. Mistargeting of these enzymes leads to tumorigenesis, but inhibition of their activity presents a novel approach to therapy. Oncogene (2001) 20, 2988-2990.},

The mutations and genes identified in this fashion showed strong relevance to cancer, in contrast to noncoding mutations with site-specific recurrence only. We developed a prediction method that identifies potentially recurrent mutations on the basis of the features shared by mutations whose recurrence is observed in a given cohort. Our method was capable of accurately predicting recurrent mutations at the level of target genes but not mutations recurring at the same site. We experimentally validated predicted mutations in distal regulatory regions of the {TERT} gene.

Deciphering the molecular determinants of this variation will be aided by the elucidation of distinct types of mutations, as they differ in regional preferences and in associations with genomic features. Chromatin organization contributes to regional variation in mutation rates, but its contribution differs among mutation types. In both germline and somatic mutations, base substitutions are more abundant in regions of closed chromatin, perhaps reflecting error accumulation late in replication. By contrast, a distinctive mutational state with very high levels of insertions and deletions (indels) and substitutions is enriched in regions of open chromatin. These associations indicate an intricate interplay between the nucleotide sequence of {DNA} and its dynamic packaging into chromatin, and have important implications for current biomedical research. This Review focuses on recent studies showing associations between chromatin state and mutation rates, including pairwise and multivariate investigations of germline and somatic (particularly cancer) mutations.},

Instead, different human genomic regions vary by up to fivefold in the local density of cancer somatic mutations, posing a fundamental problem for statistical methods used in cancer genomics. Epigenomic organization has been proposed as a major determinant of the cancer mutational landscape. However, both somatic mutagenesis and epigenomic features are highly cell-type-specific. We investigated the distribution of mutations in multiple independent samples of diverse cancer types and compared them to cell-type-specific epigenomic features. Here we show that chromatin accessibility and modification, together with replication timing, explain up to 86\% of the variance in mutation rates along cancer genomes. The best predictors of local somatic mutation density are epigenomic features derived from the most likely cell type of origin of the corresponding malignancy. Moreover, we find that cell-of-origin chromatin features are much stronger determinants of cancer mutation profiles than chromatin features of matched cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we show that the cell type of origin of a cancer can be accurately determined based on the distribution of mutations along its genome. Thus, the {DNA} sequence of a cancer genome encompasses a wealth of information about the identity and epigenomic features of its cell of origin.},

We show that there is significant variation in the density of mutations at the 1-Mb scale within three cancer genomes and that the density of mutations is correlated between them. We also demonstrate that the density of mutations is correlated to that in the germline, as measured by the divergence between humans and chimpanzees and humans and macaques. We show that the density of mutations is correlated to the guanine and cytosine ({GC}) conent, replication time, distance to telomere and centromere, gene density, and nucleosome occupancy in the cancer genomes. However, overall, all factors explain less than 40\% of the variance in mutation density and each factor explains very little of the variance. We find that genes associated with cancer occupy regions of the genome with significantly lower mutation rates than the average. Finally, we show that the density of mutations varies at a 10-Mb and a chromosomal scale, but that the variation at these scales is weak. Hum Mutat 33:136–143, 2012. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The strong association between mutation rates and chromatin organization is upheld in samples from different tissues and for different mutation types.

A significant component of cancer etiology has been deemed stochastic and correlated with the number of stem cells in a tissue, the number of times the stem cells divide and a low incidence of random {DNA} polymerase errors that occur during each cell division. While somatic mutations occur during each round of {DNA} replication, mutations in cancer driver genes are not stochastic. Out of a total of 2843 codons, 1031 can be changed to stop codons by a single base substitution in the tumor suppressor {APC} gene, which is mutated in 76\% of colorectal cancers ({CRC}). However, the nonsense mutations, which comprise 65\% of all the {APC} driver mutations in {CRC}, are not random: 43\% occur at Arg {CGA} codons, although they represent \&lt;3\% of the codons. In {TP}53, {CGA} codons comprise \&lt;3\% of the total 393 codons but they account for 72\% and 39\% of the mutations in {CRC} and ovarian cancer {OVC}, respectively. This mutation pattern is consistent with the kinetically slow, but not stochastic, hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine residues at specific methylated {CpG} sites to afford T·G mismatches that lead to C → T transitions and stop codons at {CGA}. Analysis of nonsense mutations in {CRC}, {OVC} and a number of other cancers indicates the need to expand the predictable risk factors for cancer to include, in addition to random polymerase errors, the methylation status of gene body {CGA} codons in tumor suppressor genes.},

Despite their prevalence, the contribution of somatic {MS} indels to cancer has been largely unexplored, owing to difficulties in detecting them in short-read sequencing data. Here we present two tools: {MSMuTect}, for accurate detection of somatic {MS} indels, and {MSMutSig}, for identification of genes containing {MS} indels at a higher frequency than expected by chance. Applying {MSMuTect} to whole-exome data from 6,747 human tumors representing 20 tumor types, we identified {\textgreater}1,000 previously undescribed {MS} indels in cancer genes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the number and pattern of {MS} indels can accurately distinguish microsatellite-stable tumors from tumors with microsatellite instability, thus potentially improving classification of clinically relevant subgroups. Finally, we identified seven {MS} indel driver hotspots: four in known cancer genes ({ACVR}2A, {RNF}43, {JAK}1, and {MSH}3) and three in genes not previously implicated as cancer drivers ({ESRP}1, {PRDM}2, and {DOCK}3).},
