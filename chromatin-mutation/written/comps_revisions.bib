	abstract = {Characterizing the errors generated by common high-throughput sequencing platforms and telling true genetic variation from technical artefacts are two interdependent steps, essential to many analyses such as single nucleotide variant calling, haplotype inference, sequence assembly and evolutionary studies. Both random and systematic errors can show a specific occurrence profile for each of the six prominent sequencing platforms surveyed here: 454 pyrosequencing, Complete Genomics {DNA} nanoball sequencing, Illumina sequencing by synthesis, Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing, Pacific Biosciences single-molecule real-time sequencing and Oxford Nanopore sequencing. There is a large variety of programs available for error removal in sequencing read data, which differ in the error models and statistical techniques they use, the features of the data they analyse, the parameters they determine from them and the data structures and algorithms they use. We highlight the assumptions they make and for which data types these hold, providing guidance which tools to consider for benchmarking with regard to the data properties. While no benchmarking results are included here, such specific benchmarks would greatly inform tool choices and future software development. The development of stand-alone error correctors, as well as single nucleotide variant and haplotype callers, could also benefit from using more of the knowledge about error profiles and from (re)combining ideas from the existing approaches presented here.},

	abstract = {Error Correction is important for most next-generation sequencing applications because highly accurate sequenced reads will likely lead to higher quality results. Many techniques for error correction of sequencing data from next-gen platforms have been developed in the recent years. However, compared with the fast development of sequencing technologies, there is a lack of standardized evaluation procedure for different error-correction methods, making it difficult to assess their relative merits and demerits. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of many error-correction methods, and establish a common set of benchmark data and evaluation criteria to provide a comparative assessment. We present experimental results on quality, run-time, memory usage and scalability of several error-correction methods. Apart from providing explicit recommendations useful to practitioners, the review serves to identify the current state of the art and promising directions for future research.

We present a new Eulerian assembler that generates nearly optimal short read assemblies of bacterial genomes and describe an approach to assemble reads in the case of the popular hybrid protocol when short and long Sanger-based reads are combined.},

	abstract = {New {DNA} sequencing technologies deliver data at dramatically lower costs but demand new analytical methods to take full advantage of the very short reads that they produce. We provide an initial, theoretical solution to the challenge of de novo assembly from whole-genome shotgun “microreads.” For 11 genomes of sizes up to 39 Mb, we generated high-quality assemblies from 80× coverage by paired 30-base simulated reads modeled after real Illumina-Solexa reads. The bacterial genomes of Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli assemble optimally, yielding single perfect contigs, and larger genomes yield assemblies that are highly connected and accurate. Assemblies are presented in a graph form that retains intrinsic ambiguities such as those arising from polymorphism, thereby providing information that has been absent from previous genome assemblies. For both C. jejuni and E. coli, this assembly graph is a single edge encompassing the entire genome. Larger genomes produce more complicated graphs, but the vast majority of the bases in their assemblies are present in long edges that are nearly always perfect. We describe a general method for genome assembly that can be applied to all types of {DNA} sequence data, not only short read data, but also conventional sequence reads.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Second-generation sequencing technologies produce a massive amount of short reads in a single experiment. However, sequencing errors can cause major problems when using this approach for de novo sequencing applications. Moreover, existing error correction methods have been designed and optimized for shotgun sequencing. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the design of fast and accurate computational methods and tools for error correction of large amounts of short read data.Results: We present {SHREC}, a new algorithm for correcting errors in short-read data that uses a generalized suffix trie on the read data as the underlying data structure. Our results show that the method can identify erroneous reads with sensitivity and specificity of over 99\% and 96\% for simulated data with error rates of up to 3\% as well as for real data. Furthermore, it achieves an error correction accuracy of over 80\% for simulated data and over 88\% for real data. These results are clearly superior to previously published approaches. {SHREC} is available as an efficient open-source Java implementation that allows processing of 10 million of short reads on a standard workstation.Availability: {SHREC} source code in {JAVA} is freely available at http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/∼jasc/Shrec/Contact:jasc@informatik.uni-kiel.de},

However, existing methods typically miss low-allelic-fraction mutations that occur in only a subset of the sequenced cells owing to either tumor heterogeneity or contamination by normal cells. Here we present {MuTect}, a method that applies a Bayesian classifier to detect somatic mutations with very low allele fractions, requiring only a few supporting reads, followed by carefully tuned filters that ensure high specificity. We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, {MuTect} has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making {MuTect} particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.},
